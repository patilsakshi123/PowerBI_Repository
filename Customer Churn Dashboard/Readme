ðŸ“Š Churn Analysis Dashboard Project
This project showcases a complete end-to-end solution for analyzing and predicting customer churn using real-world data. 
The dashboard was built using SQL Server, Power BI, and Python (Random Forest) for machine learning.

ðŸ”§ Key Features:
1) ETL Pipeline: Built robust data pipelines in SQL Server for importing, cleaning, and transforming customer data (demographics, services, payments, churn).

2) Power BI Visualizations: Created dynamic dashboards to track churn rate, customer segmentation, revenue insights, and service usage.

3) Data Modeling: Designed an efficient data model and implemented DAX measures for KPIs such as total customers, churn rate, and new joiners.

4) Machine Learning Integration: Developed a Random Forest model in Python to predict churn; evaluated with classification report and confusion matrix.

5) Predictive Dashboard: Integrated ML predictions into Power BI to visualize high-risk customers and support business decisions.

6) UI Enhancements: Applied custom themes, layout design, and visual storytelling for better user experience and insight delivery.
